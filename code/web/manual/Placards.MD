## Placards
- Placards are a way to showcase or advertise certain programs, events, databases, online resources or other features in your discovery system.
- Highlighting these placards gives your users extra exposure to programs, events, databases, online resources they may not be aware of. 
- When the user performs a search, any term that matches the keyword of your placard, it will populate a placard in the result list. In the example below, a search for music will bring up a placard for Freegal music. Placards can be configured in Administration.
