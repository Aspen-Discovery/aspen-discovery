## Event Indexing Updates
- Make sure not to index private events.
- Make the event source searchable within Solr to ensure that events can be deleted properly.

## Hold Updates
- Store a patron's preferred pickup location independently of their home library and allow libraries to not let patrons set a preferred pickup location. This allows libraries that do not allow patrons to update their home library to still allow patrons to select a different preferred pickup location.  The preferred pickup location can be set when placing a hold or from My Preferences. 
  ![Preferred Pickup Location In Preferences](/release_notes/images/21_01_00_preferred_pickup_location.png)  
- When the patron remembers their hold location, display the pickup location within the success message and if there are multiple possible pickup locations, add a link for how to change the default location.
  ![Hold Pickup Location Message](/release_notes/images/21_01_00_hold_pickup_location_message.png)  
- Allow libraries to disable allowing a patron from remembering their preferred pickup location.
- Allow libraries to disable allowing a patron from changing their home library. 
- When placing a hold on a title, check to see if all items have an associated volume, and if not give the patron the option to place a title level hold rather than a volume level hold.
