## Full Subject Facet

Aspen Discovery pulls full subject facets from the following fields and subfields:

### Within the 600 field:
* If the subfield is >= 'a' AND <= 'h' OR >= 'j' AND <= 'v' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 600.

### Within the 610 field:
* If the subfield is >= 'a' AND <= 'h' OR >= 'j' AND <= 'v' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 610.

### Within the 611 field:
* If the subfield is 'a' OR >= 'c' AND <= 'h' OR >= 'k' AND <= 'l' OR the subfield is 'n' OR 'p' OR the subfield is 's' OR the subfield is >= 'p' AND <= 'v' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 611.

### Within the 630 field:
* If the subfield is 'a' OR 'b' OR >= 'f' AND <= 'h' OR >= 'k' AND <= 'p' OR >= 'r' AND <= 't' OR >= 'v' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 630.

### Within the 650 field:
* If the subfield is >= 'a' AND <= 'e' OR >= 'v' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject.

### Within the 651 field:
* If the subfield is >= 'a' AND <= 'e' OR >= 'v' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 651.

### Within the 655 field:
* If the subfield is >= 'a' AND <= 'c' OR >= 'v' OR >= 'x' & <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 655.

### Within the 690 field:
* If the subfield is 'a' OR >= 'x' AND <= 'z' then those subfields are combined into the full subject. This will happen for each instance of the 690.
