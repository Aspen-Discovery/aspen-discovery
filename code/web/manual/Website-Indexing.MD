## Website Indexing

Aspen Discovery has the ability to pull information from your website and add it to the search results. These will be listed in "library website" in the search drop-down menu and will also appear in the Explore More secton of a library catalog search. 

Website indexing can be set up in the Website Indexing module of the administration menu. This module can be enabled in System Administration Modules. In the module, you will be able to add websites that can be discoverable in your Aspen system.

You are also able to see the indexing log and website indexing dashboard through the Website Indexing module.
