			 The response format differs from solr1.1 formatting and returns a standard error code.

			 To enable solr1.1 behavior, remove the /update handler or change its path

	<!-- Field Analysis Request Handler

	RequestHandler that provides much the same functionality as
	analysis.jsp. Provides the ability to specify multiple field
	types and field names in the same request and outputs
	index-time and query-time analysis for each of them.

	Request parameters are:
	analysis.fieldname - field name whose analyzers are to be used

	analysis.fieldtype - field type whose analyzers are to be used
	analysis.fieldvalue - text for index-time analysis
	q (or analysis.q) - text for query time analysis
	analysis.showmatch (true|false) - When set to true and when
	query analysis is performed, the produced tokens of the
	field value analysis will be marked as "matched" for every
	token that is produces by the query analysis
	-->

	<!-- Document Analysis Handler

	http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler

	An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
	process of provided documents. This handler expects a (single)
	content stream with the following format:

	<docs>
	<doc>
	<field name="id">1</field>
	<field name="name">The Name</field>
	<field name="text">The Text Value</field>
	</doc>
	<doc>...</doc>
	<doc>...</doc>
	...
	</docs>

	Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
	unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
	an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.

	Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
	query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
	request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
	also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
	true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
	as a "match".
