##Setting Up a Development Environment
Aspen uses a LAMP or WAMP stack to run.  We have developers using both Windows and Mac OS X for development with success. 
If you plan to run on Windows, we recommend using a WAMP package like those created by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp/installer). 
When selecting an installer, select an installer that includes PHP 7.3 (we will update to PHP 8.0 later this year). 

We recommend the following tools for Aspen development due to their ease of use and ability to debug code easily. 
- [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
- [IntelliJ Idea Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
PhpStorm does have a small subscription fee, but we find it to be very worthwhile. 
  
Once you have setup your LAMP/WAMP stack and your development tools, you can proceed to:
- [Installing Aspen on Linux or Mac OSX](/Admin/HelpManual?page=Installing-Aspen-Linux)
- [Installing Aspen on Windows](/Admin/HelpManual?page=Installing-Aspen-Windows)

*Note after installing Bitnami for Windows, you will want to [add the PHP runtime to your path](https://www.google.com/search?q=adding+a+file+to+windows+path) to make running scripts from Aspen Discovery easier.  After adding PHP to your path, you will need to restart Windows.
