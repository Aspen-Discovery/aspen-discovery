## Covers

 - Cover images can be pulled into Aspen from various outlets. Administrators can use free resources such as a COCE server for book images and OMDb for movies, or connect to third party services like Syndetics or Content Cafe. 
    - Coce is a remote image URL cache. With this option, cover images are not fetched directly from Amazon, Google, and Open Library. Their URLs are requested via a web service to Coce which manages a cache of URLs.
      - Coce currently will check Amazon Web Services, Google Books or Open Library.
    - OMDB (Open Movie Database) 
       - The OMDb is a web service to obtain movie information where all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by OMDb users.
    - Syndetics (ProQuest)
    - Content Cafe (Baker & Taylor)
