### Creating a New Location

- Locations is where you define individual branches of a Library System. 
- To create a location, click the 'Add New' box.
- If you have more than one location, you can click the small checkbox next to two and click 'Compare' at the bottom of the list to see the similarities and differences in configuration for the two.
- To edit already created location you can either click the 'Edit' box on the right hand side of the screen or click the location ID
- Underneath the edit button the right hand side, there is a 'History' box. This shows you changes made in the configuration. 

- Within the configuration of location, you can define the following things:
  - Subdomain for their URL
  - Code is the database branchcode for this branch location within your ILS
  - Display name is the full name of the library
  - Searching options, like if lists are searchable
  - Full record display allows you to give patrons the ability to share records on external sites or through email 
  - You can choose what Overdrive, Hoopla, RBDigital, and Cloud Library accounts to use

- Locations is a lot like Library System but when you have multiple branches within a system you need to define at a branch level as well.
