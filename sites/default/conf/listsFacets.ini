; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the

; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.

; Leave the section empty if you do not need checkbox facets.

; NOTE: Do not create CheckboxFacets using values that also exist in the
;       other facet sections above -- this will not work correctly.
