## Themes

Themes can be customized through the Theme & Layout section of the administration menu. While almost everything can be customized in Aspen through this page including the logo and favicon, the sections that are most important are the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. However, the colors for everything in Aspen can be changed through this page.
