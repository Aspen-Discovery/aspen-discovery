## ILS Integration

The Aspen Discovery system is able to connect with any ILS system. In the administration menu under ILS Integration, you are able to define how records from your ILS are loaded into Aspen. 

It is important to determine the audience in the ILS Integration menu. You can also customize item types and formats in this menu under Format Information, customize status fields under Status Mappings, Run Full Update to force a fresh MARC extract, and define translation maps.

You are also able to see the indexing log and ILS Integration dashboard through the ILS Integration module.
