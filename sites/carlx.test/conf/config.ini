; Please set the ILS that VuFind will interact with.
;
; Available drivers: Aleph, Amicus, Evergreen, Horizon (basic database access only),
;       HorizonXMLAPI (more features via API), Innovative, Koha, NewGenLib, Unicorn,
;       Virtua, Voyager (for Voyager 6+), VoyagerRestful (for Voyager 7+ w/ RESTful
;       web services), XCNCIP (for XC NCIP Toolkit v1.x), XCNCIP2 (for XC NCIP Tookit
;       v2.x)
; Note: Unicorn users should visit the vufind-unicorn project for more details:
;       http://code.google.com/p/vufind-unicorn/
;
; If you don't have an ILS, two fake drivers are available for testing purposes.
; "Sample" is fast but does very little; "Demo" simulates more functionality of
; a real ILS but may slow down your system by performing extra searches.
;
; Note: Enabling most of the features in this section will only work if you use an
; ILS driver that supports them; not all drivers support holds/renewals.
