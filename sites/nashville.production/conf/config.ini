; Please set the ILS that Aspen will interact with.
;
; If you don't have an ILS, two fake drivers are available for testing purposes.
; "Sample" is fast but does very little; "Demo" simulates more functionality of
; a real ILS but may slow down your system by performing extra searches.
;
; Note: Enabling most of the features in this section will only work if you use an
; ILS driver that supports them; not all drivers support holds/renewals.
